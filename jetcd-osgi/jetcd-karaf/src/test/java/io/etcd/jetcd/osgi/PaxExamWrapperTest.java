/**
 * Pax Exam test wrapper which starts (and stops) an etcd test server via
 * launcher. We need to do this because jetcd-launcher uses Testcontainers,
 * which cannot run inside OSGi (due to the use of TCL loadClass(String) in
 * DockerClientProviderStrategy). And even if we were to use the launcher only
 * in the config() method (which "is executed before the OSGi container is
 * launched, so it does run in plain Java"), the Pax Exam probe still needs to
 * load the entire test class and all of its references (launcher with
 * Testcontainers) into OSGi, which is a PITA. There is also no easy way to stop
 * the testcontainer after. It is therefore simplest to just launch the etcd
 * server before getting Pax Exam's world, like this does.
